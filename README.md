# Shellex

Shellex allows you to run shell commands from your ruby scripts in a more robust and secure way than the built-in options.
We had a security audit in http://beanstalkapp.com recently which showed many problems caused by shell injections. This code
 is the result of our attempt to fix these issues once and for all.

## Installation
